# Volumetric Display Board
This is the KiCAD EDA files for a Persistence of Vision-based volumetric display based on the Zero Tiny BLE model by Zero Engineering (zeroengineering.io). It uses the following components:
* ATTiny85 for processing and control
* a 9x16 LED array from Adafruit (not included in CAD) for the visual output
* HM-10 bluetooth radio for relaying to/from the device
* a 3.7V rechargeable LiPo battery for power
